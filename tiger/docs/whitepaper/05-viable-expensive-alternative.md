title: E) Viable and Expensive Alternative
---

Alternative path:

- Keep Keccak Merkle tree and build a heavier circuit stack around it.

It is viable, but expensive in practice:

- larger proving complexity
- slower proving UX
- higher operator costs and tighter infrastructure requirements

BlueARC chose Poseidon V2 to reduce this operational drag while preserving protocol goals.
